Application Flow

The OPD Management System is a server-rendered web application built using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, MySQL, and Jinja2 templates. It manages patients, appointments, and consultations through a status-driven workflow.

Flow Overview

Patient Registration

User creates a new patient via the Patient form.

Patient is stored with default status Active.

Appointment Booking

User selects an Active patient.

Books an appointment with doctor name and date/time.

Appointment is created with default status Scheduled.

Consultation Workflow

Consultation can be started only for Scheduled appointments.

Consultation begins in Draft status.

When marked Completed, the related appointment automatically becomes Completed.

Viewing Data

Users can:

Search patients

View today's appointments

Start consultations

View consultation status

This ensures the workflow is controlled by the backend and follows business rules.

🗄️ Table Relationships

The application uses a relational database with the following relationships:

1. Patients Table

Primary entity storing patient information.

One patient can have multiple appointments and consultations.

2. Appointments Table

Linked to patients using patient_id.

One appointment belongs to one patient.

One appointment can have only one consultation.

3. Consultations Table

Linked to both appointment and patient.

Ensures consultation history per patient.
